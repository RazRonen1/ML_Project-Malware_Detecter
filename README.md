# ML_Project-Malware_Detecter

This project was made as part of the 'Machine Learning' course in the Engineering faculty at Tel-Aviv University.

The final result is a ML classifier model that detects malicious files, that was trained on Microsoft's 'EMBER' 

The project is made out of 3 parts:
1. Exploration & Analysis of the data
2. Extensive Pre-Processing
3. Training, testing and evaluating different complex ML models

It includes:
* The complete notebook that contains all 3 parts
* The final report that summarizes the results
* The dataset separated to train & test
